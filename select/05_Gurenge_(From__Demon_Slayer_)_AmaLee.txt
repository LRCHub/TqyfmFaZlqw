Finally, you've given me
A reason to be strong
And we'll stand
Hand in hand
'Til the end

As my body's shaking
The future is out there waiting
For me to grasp the light
That's trembling just like my hand
I gotta keep it safe from fading
That's all that I want

The subtle scent of midnight
(I'll spend all thirty nights)
I glare up at the stars
(Staring into the sky)
The path I see before me
I know only I can change it
That's all that I need

Finally, you've given me
A reason to be strong
And we'll stand
Hand in hand
'Til the end

Despite the past mistakes we can't erase
A future that we can't escape
As long as I can always keep you safe
I've gotta be strong
So to your name
I'll fight through the pain

This world can
Beat me down a hundred times
But into the light I'll always rise
A lotus flower's so pure
Right up to the end
Until it blooms
A bright red

I can hear the lightning
There's not a song more frightening
And like a storm you can't control some things in this world
Not everything can be protected
I already know that

Good and evil, they will always want to intertwine
Our true nature hiding beneath the surface
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me-
I don't need you
Like a wild flower growing tall
There is beauty in the way you live and thrive despite it all

This road is
Overgrown with deadly thorns
Like an endless night of violent storms
But for your sake, through all the twists and turns
I'll try to be brave
With only my love
I'm rising above

The dreams I
Tried but couldn't bring to life
And the ones I only see at night
They're rooted deep in my heart
That's where they'll remain
I'll let them grow wild
In my veins

A meaningless conclusion calls
So quietly, the curtain falls
A broken scream upon the wind
But none to hear the heartless sin
The shadow of a laughing soul
The sorrow of a heart wishing
Only for love
Only for light
Only for life

Despite the past mistakes we can't erase
A future that we can't escape
As long as I can always keep you safe
I've gotta be strong
So to your name
I'll fight through the pain

This world can
Beat me down a hundred times
But into the light, I'll always rise
A lotus flower's so pure
Right up to the end
Until it blooms
A bright red

Until it blooms
A bright red
